This application is a prototype that was created for COVID-19.

The idea is that in one application (The user application) the user will be able to take photos of violating social distancing and other rules in place and have the opportunity to add specific data.

The next step is that in another application (reporting application) the correct authorities will be able to access the information stored in a cloud database and then retrieve all data that the users have entered.
This includes maps of points with data and manual reports.

The unique feature of this application is:

- How fast it can retrieve the data and input.
- Take images and compress it online into a storage bucket that can be retrieved easily.
- Use google maps to add real time markers connected from the database with information about each point and take you to certain points within a click of a button.
- Get the users location and convert this information into locality, postal code and even the country.

There are more features that can be explored but these are the top 4 key points to mention.
